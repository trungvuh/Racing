# Racing Car

A multiplayers car racing experience. Built entirely on JavaScript and HTML5.

The game was made with arcade-style mindset, so there will be no mouse movement control, only keyboards. Sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope it brings back the sweet childhood memory.

Racers can race each other on multiple laps. One controls the car with arrow keys, the other uses "WASD" keys.

**Note:** Grass/ Sand is passable, though it will slow the car down and racer loses control of the car.

**Hidden feature:** press "Q" or "/" for honk.
